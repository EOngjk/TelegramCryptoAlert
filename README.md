# TelegramCryptoAlert
A Telegram Bot that provides real-time updates on Cryptocurrency Price

This telegram bot was a group project for ECON3086 - Python Programming for Economic and Business Analysis.

I use Pycharm IDE Free Edition for this project.

Here are the APIs used:

1. TelegramBot API ---> I created one with Telegram's BotFather
2. CoinMarketCap API ---> I created our own account with CoinMarketCap's FREE API subscription.

Here are a few functions it has:

1. /start -> Starts the ECON3086_CryptoPriceAlertBot!
2. /help -> Shows all available commands
3. /my_portfolio -> Shows your current portfolio holdings
4. /current_price -> Get the current real-time price of your desired crypto coin & currency.
5. /set_alert -> Get a real-time alert when the price of your desired crypto coin has reached your target price.
6. /remove_alert -> Remove any price alert of your choice.
7. /check_alert -> Shows current price alert in place.
8. /place_trade -> Buy or sell your desired crypto
9. /exit -> Ends chat with @ECON3086_CryptoPriceAlertbot


How to run the Telegram Bot?
1. Make sure to run your python console before you start.
2. Go on to Telegram (web or mobile).
3. Go to your bot name and press start.
4. It should work. 


I hope that this code helps if you are making a similar telegrambot yourself! It took some time but it was fun :D!
